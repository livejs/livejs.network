# { Live : JS }

Live audio visual performances with JavaScript. [Website here](http://livejs.network/)

## Who are you?
We're a group of web devs who got together due to a common love of all things audio, visual and MIDI \o/

## Why did you start this group?
We wanted somewhere to talk about the things we're building, share information about our approach to programming MIDI interfaces, analysing audio, generating visuals, all with lovely JavaScript, all within the lovely browser!

## So what are your plans?
It's still early days, so we're still coming up with a zillion ideas a minute! We're hoping that by sharing information and having a hub to chat, we'll start to push the boundaries of what we can do with this emerging tech. Plus build some awesome stuff of course :)

## This all sounds gravy, how do I get involved?
Join our Slack! We thought it the best place to start, just to come and chat... even if it's just to help each other out with some of the APIs. We'll be super excited to have you!
